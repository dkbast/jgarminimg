For the moment, this library has been tested with:
  - Swiss Topo 50 maps
  - Maps generated with sdts2mp (http://mapcenter.cgpsmapper.com)
  - European metro guide V7 and V8.
  - City Navigator non-NT V9
  - Worldmap 4.06

Maps that I know doesn't work:
  - City Nav North America v8 cannot deal with the file structure
  - NT maps, the compressed maps are not supported

To build, you'll need an installed j2sdk1.5 (or 6) and Maven. Then,
you can run:
  $ mvn compile
  
To run the sample application:
  $ mvn compile exec:java


SampleApp "user manual"
=======================

You can open a single .img file or a whole directory containing .img files.
For example, with "European metro guide, you can copy every .img files you
find in mgeurop7, the MGEuro7.img (base map) and the MGEuro7.tdb (product
info) in a single directory and open this directory with SampleApp.

To zoom in/out, use the mouse wheel and to move around, drag with the left
button (actualy done only when the button is released).

To get some info about something on the map, right click on it without
moving the mouse.

You can export the map to PNG, SVG and PDF with File->Export. Choose the
target file and the format. Then, use the left map to choose the zone to
export. You can see a preview of the output quality (depends on the
resolution for PDF and the dimension for PNG and SVG) on the right map.

See http://sourceforge.net/projects/jgarminimg/ for the latest version and
more info. For the latest version use CVS.


Warning
=======

In some country, this software may be illegal. For example, in the USA,
this may fall under the DMCA because some heavy cryptographic algorithm
have been cracked in ImgFileInputStream. So watch your back if you don't
live in a "free" country.
